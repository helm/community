## Abstract

This HIP is built on top [HIP-0015](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/main/hips/hip-0015.md), taking it a step further.

While the original document described a standard way of declaring Helm Charts' images through `annotations`, here we propose a new way of generating a complete snapshot view of all the container images existing at the time of packaging a Helm Chart: **an images lock file**. This file would be uploaded to OCI registries alongside the Charts, providing both evidence and inventory data needed to simplify the process of moving Helm Charts between registries and deploying them into air gapped environments.

## Motivation

Container images are stored separately from Helm Charts. On one hand, this makes the Chart really small in size. But on the other one, this adds many challenges in terms of distribution and network access to images, which could be avoided if the application was self-contained.

The lack of an image inventory in addtition to this decoupling, makes the use of Helm difficult on airgapped scenarios. An organization trying to install a Chart avoiding connections to external repositories would have to previously: 

* Migrate the images the chart relies on to its isolated registry (same for `dependencies`)
* Update the Chart with the new references (same for `dependencies`)
* Push the modified Chart to the isolated registry (same for `dependencies`)
* Install the Chart

All of this through manual steps.

In addition to this, there's no standard way of declaring the images a Chart depends on. This forces users to rely on self-made conventions for the values files plus external tooling, or to declare these images in other places (with again another self-made structure). Following up with the example shown above, the same organization then would have to:

* Identify the images the chart relies on (same for `dependencies`)
* Migrate the images the chart relies on to the isolated registry (same for `dependencies`)
* Update the Chart with the new references (same for `dependencies`)
* Push the modified Chart to the isolated registry (same for `dependencies`)
* Install the Chart

If Helm provides support for the images lock file, many of these could be just addressed as part of the tool, automating the process and making the users lives easier.

## Rationale

During the drafting of this approach, many alternatives found on the internet were considered and discarded.

The first option one could think of is rendering the chart and parsing the images from the equivalent Kubernetes manifests. From that point, it would be relatively easy to do the rest. However, post-render attempts of getting the images list aren't be reliable, as the manifests change depending on the attributes of the values files, or the user input.

Some vendors like ArtifactHub use [annotations](https://github.com/artifacthub/hub/blob/master/charts/artifact-hub/Chart.yaml#L80), others like OpenShift use their own [proprietary fields](https://github.com/mongodb/helm-charts/blob/39df2aa9bc77e9f34c02c18ab7dbac172e5134a1/charts/enterprise-operator/values-openshift.yaml) in values files. Both end up falling into the same basket: promoting self-made conventions that aren't either backed up by an official specification, or supported by Helm itself natively.

A third approach would be trying to `grep` the images references out of the Chart files. Again, this ends up being an attempt of promoting self-made conventions in order to make the _grepping_ work. Discussing this poinrt, we brought Operators to the table. These components may rely on images which aren't declared on the helm files, but pulled directly from the source code.

Thus, we came to the conclussion that:

* There's already a HIP promoting the declaration of images through `annotations`
* This file may be user-friendly (easy to write) but not machine-friendly (lacks of specification, misses digests...)
* An `images-lock.yaml` (or similarly named) would be backed up by a spec. plus it could contain other useful information such as the images' digests
* Helm could internally generate this file out of the `annotations` proposed in `HIP-0015`
* Helm could apply an existing `images-lock.yaml` file to the _post-rendered_ manifests to enforce a BOM (just like others such as `npm` do with their `packages-lock.yml`)
* By parsing this file, Helm could help users to migrate Charts between registries, either by providing new commands or through new features in the existing ones

## Specification

This is an example of the potential `images-lock` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v0
kind: ImagesLock
metadata:
  generatedAt: "2022-09-26T14:43:00.026746763Z"
  generatedBy: Helm
chart:
  name: wordpress
  version: 10.3.6
  location: oci://an-oci-repo.com/bitnami/wordpress:10.3.6
  digest: sha256:60f13c95c1a2dd37f25fe31e9cf3525704a544261a0b4c6b36f212990911b2c9
images:
  - name: wordpress
    image: docker.io/bitnami/wordpress:6.0.2-debian-11-r9
    digest: sha256:b4cb055a643d1d51d1678f3e011cf008b227852bc0a4118126deeed844ccfb6a

    chart: wordpress
  - name: apache-exporter
    image: docker.io/bitnami/apache-exporter:0.11.0-debian-11-r42
    digest: sha256:ea4aa97834500297e4252f5f98492c52a7bfd1993bd5ef4e485ae84996b1c63a
    chart: wordpress
  - name: memcached
    image: docker.io/bitnami/memcached:1.6.17-debian-11-r6
    digest: sha256:337a65b5c6e98e4f91606caf66b09b40b21f30b0a67749d5aa705eca1d501be5
    chart: memcached
```

Ideally, the file would only contain references to images needed within the main chart, assuming that the dependencies already declare their own inventory. Yet, the specification would allow to pin images used outside the main chart (used in the dependencies), like we're doing here with `memcached`.

This file should be distributed either alongside or within the chart being distributed. This means, that Helm should either package the `images-lock.yml` side within the chart before distributing it, or push it to the OCI registry as another blob. If the second approach is decided, the blob could be named after the chart checksum, similarly to what [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#sign-a-container-and-store-the-signature-in-the-registry) does with signatures.

## Backwards compatibility

There isn0t any backward incompatibility, since there's no modification of any existing specification. Charts making use of the `annotations` and `images-lock` file would benefit of the feature, others just wouldn't.
