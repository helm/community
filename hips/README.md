# Helm Improvement Proposals (HIPs)

To learn more about the purpose of HIPs and how to go about writing a proposal,
please start reading [HIP 1](hip-0001.md).

## Markdown for Proposals

Original proposal source should be written in Markdown format, and the format is
described in HIP 1. Older proposals were often written in a more mildly
restricted markdown format and can be found in the
[archives](archives/README.md).
