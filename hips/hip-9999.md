## Abstract

Add an optional release-tag flag that will be added to the release metadata.

## Motivation

Many organizations write a helm chart that they use internally and is not tied to any specific source code. This makes the appVersion in the Chart.yaml file useless because it never gets updated. In addition, appVersion cannot be changed easily on the fly. Adding a release-tag flag for `helm install` and `helm upgrade` gives users the ability to add in important information about the deployment. For example If you need to do a helm rollback to a specific version, its currently difficult to figure out what commit or branch you should rollback to. 

## Rationale

Add a `--release-tag` flag to `helm install` and `helm upgrade` and give `Release Tag` its own column for the `helm history` command. The flag should be optional and not required.

## Specification

Running helm install should look look this
`helm install <release> --release-tag`

Running helm upgrade should look like this
`helm upgrade <release> --release-tag`

The output of helm history should look similar to this
```
go run ./ history demo-nginx
REVISION	UPDATED                 	STATUS    	CHART       	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION 	RELEASE TAG

```

## Backwards Compatibility

This is adding an additional field and is not a required flag. There should be no issue with backwards compatability.
