## Abstract

Moving from Helm 2 to Helm 3 the ability to run hooks in parallel for tests was
lost. This feature would allow for hooks to be run in parallel instead of
serially for not only tests, but for hooks in general.

## Motivation

Currently, there is no way to run hooks in parallel. While generally this would
be fine, for running tests in a CI environment the amount of time it takes to
run several tests is too long. By running in parallel running helm tests in CI
becomes much more tenable.

## Rationale

The proposed design is to add a flag called "hook-parallelism", which
defaults to 1. When hooks are run they are then run in go routines, up to, but
not exceeding the value of the flag concurrently. This will allow for users to only use the
flag if they require their hooks to run in parallel. Not including the flag,
or including the flag with a value of 0 or 1 will be the same as running
serially.

This flag will be accompanied by an opt-in annotation on hooks. This will allow
those writing tests to choose whether or not they want their hooks to be run
serially, or in parallel. Not including the annotation will default to "serial"
to preserve any need to make updates to tests that were previously be run
serially.

The benefit of providing both the flag and the annotation is allow both the
Application Operator and Application Distributor control over how tests are run.
The Application Distributor when writing tests should be able to say that tests
are able to be run in parallel, or a test specifically needs to be run serially.
The Application Operator has an understanding of what their system can handle,
if the Application Distributor has their tests all run in parallel it may not
be the case that the Application Operator wants to spend their resources on
spinning on that many hooks in parallel especially with any hooks that may be
resource intensive.

## Specification

The flag will be added to all applicable commands (install, rollback,
uninstall, upgrade, test), and will allow for any hooks attached those commands
to be run in parallel. Not including a flag will have the hooks run serially.
The actual implementation will use a semaphore based on the value of the flag
to limit the number of hooks being run. While the number of go routines run
will be equal to the number of hooks (sorted by weight), only the value of the
flag number of go routines will be run at the same time. This will allow the
user flexibility in their usage in relation to their system constraints.

The annotation will be added to the hook specification, not including the flag
will mark the test to be run serially. Hooks marked with the parallel
annotation have the ability to be run in parallel with other hooks, but may not
be depending on the Application Operator's discretion. When running in parallel
all previous hooks that are weighted less than the parallel hook will complete
before starting the parallel hook or hooks. Grouping these parallel hooks by
weight will need to be taken into account by the Application Distributor as
having every other hook by weight be a serial hook would result in only serial
execution regardless of the parallel annotation or the hook-parallelism flag.

## Backwards compatibility

This should have no backward compability issues. Not including the flag will
have the value default to 1. This will only allow one hook to run at a time,
and the user should notice no difference in the execution of their hooks.

Not including the annotation on a hook will result in the hook being marked
"serial", preserving backwards compatiblity as this is the current
functionality.

## Security implications

A malicious user could provide an unreasonably high number for the value of the
hook parallelism flag. This would set the length of the semaphore. This should
not be something that should affect the normal user.

## How to teach this

A good example would be to have two separate test hooks written. Run initially
and watch one pod spin up and run, then a second after the first has completed.
Next the flag could be added, and shown that both test pods are spun up at the
same time. It might be helpful to mention a general estimate of how many hooks
you want to run in parallel compared to the number of hooks you have associated
with a command.

## Reference implementation

Currently there is an open Github Pull Request [here](https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8946). The hook-parallelism flag functionality has been
implemented, but not reviewed. This was based on a previous Pull Request [here](https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7792) which was made from this [issue](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7763).

Currently, the parallel annotation has no implementation effort, but needs to
be added at the same time as the hook-parallelism flag.

## Rejected ideas

This is the initial implementation of the feature, and as such there have been
no other ideas to be rejected.
