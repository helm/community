## Abstract

Helm supports JSON schema validation to validate `values.yaml`.
It would be nice if JSON schema validation is also possible by editors of `values.yaml` files.
It would be nice if JSON schemas can be referenced by dependant Helm chart JSON schemas.
Both will be possible if the JSON schemas are served on separate URLs.

## Motivation

For Helm users it would be nice if they can reference JSON schemas from a Helm chart.

If a Helm chart depends on another Helm chart, its JSON schema can reference the original JSON schema like so:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "my-chart": {
      "$ref": "https://charts.example/my-chart-1.2.3.schema.json"
    }
  }
}
```

If a user wants to enable JSON schema validation and completion for `values.yaml` when using [`yaml-language-server`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server), this can be accomplished by a modeline:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://charts.example/my-chart-1.2.3.schema.json
```

## Rationale

By outputting the JSON schema next to the packaged Helm chart, Helm determines the standard output location.
Chart publishers could copy their JSON schema manually, but this isn’t standardized in any way.
If Helm determines the standard output location of such files, chart publishers are likely to use this.
Helm already outputs an additional file for signed charts. This proposal is consistent with that behaviour.

## Specification

If a Helm chart containing a `values.schema.json` is built using `helm package`, Helm will output the contents of `values.schema.jsob` alongside of it.
The file structure of the output will look like this:

```
├─ my-chart-1.2.3.json.schema
├─ my-chart-1.2.3.tgz
└─ my-chart-1.2.3.tgz.prov
```

## Backwards Compatibility

Outputting an additional file is backwards compatible.
If a chart published previously assumed a single output file, as was the case for unsigned charts, the JSON schema file is ignored.

## Security implications

This HIP has no security implications.

## How to teach this

The documentation should be updated to reflect this change.
Users should be recommended to publish the JSON file as well, thus not treating the output directory as the output, not just the Helm chart package.
