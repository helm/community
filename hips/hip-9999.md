## Abstract

There are numerous Helm maintainer groups where each can have zero or more Git
repositories associated with them. This process provides a centralized method
to document and track the maintainer groups, maintainers, and associated repos.

## Motivation

The current design uses a collection of documented and access controls to track
this information while there are several gaps in the information. The Teams.md
file attempted to track the different teams (i.e. maintainer groups, the org
maintainers, etc).

The repositories owned by a maintainer group, and the members of a group are
not documented but are instead tracked via GitHub teams. The owners are
scattered in various locations that are not consistent. In some cases they
cannot be consistent (e.g. community management which does not have a GitHub
repo). This has lead to confusion with the Org Maintainers and others.

## Rationale

There is currently no consistent manner to document the codebases associated with
a maintainer group or the members of a maintainer group. There are two examples we can look
at for this situation.

First, there are maintainer groups responsible for multiple repositories. Charts and the
Org maintainers groups are two examples with multiple repositories.
There is no location to publicly document this situation.

Second, not all maintainer groups own a repository. Community management is an example
of a maintainer group that does a significant amount of work without owning a source
repository.

This HIP aims to provide a single source of document to discover maintainer group
repositories and owners.

## Specification

The source of truth will be a YAML file name [`maintainer-groups.yaml`](../maintainer-groups.yaml)
stored at the root of the Helm community repository. It will have the following
structure:

```
maintainerGroups:
- name: Helm Core
  ownersLink: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/OWNERS
  repos:
  - https://github.com/helm/helm
  mailingList: cncf-helm-core-maintainers@lists.cncf.io
- name: Charts
  owners:
  - unguiculus
  - ...
  emeritus:
  - foxish
  - ...
  repos:
  - https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action
  - https://github.com/helm/charts-repo-actions-demo
  - ...
```

A maintainer group can only have either `ownersLink` (a URL to the location of the
owners list) or `owners` (a list of owners). It cannot have both. This enables
those who do not have a Git repo (e.g., community managers) and those with
multiple repos and no primary one (e.g., charts) to have a documented list.

When `owners` is used it can have an accompanying `emeritus`. When `ownersLink`
is used the emeritus is expected to be listed in that file.
