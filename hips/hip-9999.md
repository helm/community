## Abstract

Helm lock will allow chart consumers to keep a deployed Helm chart — a helm release — at a version of their choice.

## Motivation

Helm currently will automatically upgrade a relesae to the latest published chart version in a repository.
This allows users to always stay up to date, but it does not allow safety guarantees for consumers when charts have undesired changes.
Changes can be breaking CRD scheme, incompatability with their version of Kubernetes or infrastructure, performance degregation, or any change the cusumer doesn't want.

Chart publishers need to publish breaking changes because of Kubernetes API changes or CRD updates to remediate design flaws or critical implementation bugs.
Users can specify a `--version` when creating a release or performing an upgrade, but it is not possible to centrally know which releases need a specific version or what that version is.

Chart authors can add deprecation messages to their charts (e.g. [gitlab does this](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/architecture/decisions.html#breaking-changes-via-deprecation)) but it doesn't stop users from upgrading to releases without deprecation messages.
Chart authors can also publish breaking chart versions to new repositories but this causes more consumer pain points to discover the repositories when they do want to upgrade.

Chart authors should also use the `kubeVersion` field to specify compatible Kubernetes versions, but this may not be enough to avoid breaking changes based on other resources and controllers is the cluster.

## Rationale

If helm is "the package manager for Kubernetes" it should have similar package manager features that users are used to such as `apt` and `yum`.
With both of those package managers there is a centralized way to specify a version of a package and keep that version installed even when a user runs an `upgrade` command against a release.
Centralizing the desired version guarantees that all users, automation, and libraries that use the package manager also honor the version locks in place.

Making something native in helm that supports locking will be critical as users consume helm charts via other tools and workflows (e.g. gitops via `flux`).
It will reduce errors because `helm` commands can be run from any users machine with access to the cluster.
This is opposed to a helm plugin model where a user or tool may not have the plugin installed.

Helm releases do not have the same constraints has traditional package managers.
A cluster can have multiple versions of a chart deployed in different namespaces and each release can have various dependencies.
Because releases are self-contained on a per-release basis, version locking information should also exist within the release metadata and be read and processed during template rendering.

## Specification

To implement version locking on a release an optional field should be added to the release secret that specifies a desired version.

```
apiVersion: v1                                                           
data:                                                                 
  release: SDRzSUF...
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2021-02-23T18:07:25Z"
  desiredChartVersion: "8.0.*"             <---- this field is added
  labels:
    modifiedAt: "1614103661"
    name: ingress
    owner: helm
    status: deployed
    version: "1"
  name: sh.helm.release.v1.ingress.v1
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "47331598"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/secrets/sh.helm.release.v1.ingress.v1
  uid: 07ba4723-1cd1-43a8-a322-7d8e25f0868e
type: helm.sh/release.v1
```
_Field name and exact json path may change_

Having a desired chart version will allow customers to stay on specific chart versions based on the published chart version data.
The chart field is required to be SemVer 2 version and the `desiredChartVersion` can be an exact version match (eg `1.0.0`) or a wildcard string match (e.g. `1.*`).

The field can be added with the `helm lock` command.
It will take a release name and chart version to lock to.
```
helm lock autoscaler --version '8.*'
```
_The version is a free form field but should be validated aganist SemVer standards with `*` wildcards_

Users can also manually modify the secret to add the field, but that is not advised.

Locks can be seen in the `helm list` command.
```
NAME            NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                                  APP VERSION
autoscaler      default         1               2021-02-23 17:58:07.479425206 +0000 UTC deployed        cluster-autoscaler-8.0.0 (locked 8.*)  1.17.1
```
Current chart versions can be seen from the `helm show chart [CHART]` command.

A release could be unlocked by the command `helm lock [CHART] --unlock` or `helm lock [CHART] --version '*'`.

## Backwards compatibility

The `desiredChartVersion` field is optional and will be ignored if not present in a release.
Users will not be able to use the `helm lock` command unless the upgrade their version of helm.
Charts that have already been deployed can be modified with the added `desiredChartVersion` field at any time.

## Security implications

If there were a chart with a known security vulnerability a malicios user could lock the chart to that specific version to make upgrading required an additional step.
They may try to exploit the chart/controller while the chart is locked.

Users would first need to unlock the chart or specify a newer version of the chart before upgrading.
```
helm lock autoscaler --version '9.*'
```

## How to teach this

The primary place to teach this feature is in the helm documentation and in the `helm --help` output.
Because this is a user facing change chart creators do not need to make any changes to their charts.

## Reference implementation

TBD

## Rejected ideas

### Deprecation messages
As mentioned earlier, chart creators can add deprecation messages to their charts for breaking changes.
This is still good practice when a chart has breaking changes.
Helm release locking allows users to control the rate at which they can take updates and can be used in conjunction with deprecation messages.

### Separate chart repos
Publishing compatible charts to different repositories is additional work for chart creators and consumers.
It would required a different repo for each compatible version and could make publishing and discovering charts more complex.

It also does not solve the problem of breaking changes that happen outside of the chart based on users infrastructure or usage of the chart.
If a chart publishing a "stable" version of the chart there is currently no way for a user to stay on the stable version if new versions are published to the repository (e.g. [ACK controllers](https://aws-controllers-k8s.github.io/community/releases/#stable-helm-charts)).
Users have to know what version is stable and make sure no one runs `helm upgrade [CHART]`.

### Policy and validating web hook
There was a suggestion to use an OPA policy (eg deny specific chart version) and a ValidatingAdmissionController to perform the same functionallity.
This solution would work as desired but the error message returned from the VAC may be confusing to users.
We could make the error handling more clear in `helm` but extending that error handling to other tools may be more difficult.

Having a policy to handle these version requirements is a good idea but also requires a level of maturity for a user to be able to write the proper rego and maintain another controller.
Looking at `apt` and `yum` examples users are able to lock package versions with a text file or plugin.
Keeping a helm locking solution as close to native helm as possible — by extending the release specification — is the simplest user experience and most likely to get broader ecosystem adoption.

## Open issues

There are no helm issues that I am aware of but this topic is currently being discussed with [aws-controllers-k8s/community#698](https://github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/community/issues/698) to make sure consumers of the charts do not have breaking changes.

## Other questions

I'm adding this section to address other questions/concerns from the mailing list and other places.

### Dependency changes
* How would this prevent users from manually editing/updating resources underneath the chart using kubectl, kustomize, etc? Is this considered in-scope or out-of-scope?

This is out of scope for `helm lock`.
Charts should be explicit about what versions of dependencies they need and if a dependency cannot be met the upgrade should fail (same way apt and yum work).
Users who modify dependencies outside of helm would take whataver breaking repsonsibility that comes with.
This is similar to users who `dpkg` or `rpm` install packages instead of using `apt` and `yum`.

If I lock a yum package that requires a specific version of glibc `yum` will prevent me from upgrading glibc based on explicit version dependencies.
Helm should work in a similar way.
If a sentry chart upgrade depends on redis 2.0.0 and I lock redis to 1.9.0 then my `helm upgrade sentry` should fail because redis cannot be upgraded.

### Helmfile support
* How would other tools like Helmfile interact with this feature? How can other tools use this feature? What happens if they don't?

[Helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile) is used to declaratively configure helm commands, settings, and charts to install.
Helmfiles are used to automate `helm` commands and can also be used to declare a desired version per release.
```
releases:
  - name: vault
    namespace: vault
    version: ~1.24.1
```
While this helmfile will make sure the 1.24.1 vault chart is installed it does not prevent other systems from updating the version of the release.
It is good practice to only deploy charts with a helmfile, but does not block upgrades or changes to the release.

A release lock can be used in conjuction with a helm file, but it does not require any additional changes.
Helmfiles work similarly to configuration management systems on operating systems or language specific dependency files (eg requirements.txt).

If I lock a yum package version on a system and then use a tool like ansible to try and install a different version of that package the ansible command will fail and be shown to the user.
A similar error handling and reporting should be used for a helm release lock and tools like helmfile if users try to install a different version.

Any changes to helmfile, flux, or other helm automation tools are out of scope for this HIP.

### Locked release discovery
* Where do I find out which packages are marked as "held" or "unheld"?
 
One possible solution to this is shown in the specification section.
It may be desirable to have a `list` command like apt and yum, but the lock information could also be displayed as part of other helm commands that show information about releases.

### Locking scope
* If I lock `nginx-ingress-vX.X.X`, does that apply to only one release, one namespace, or cluster-wide? Can I apply this lock across different scopes?

A lock should only apply per release.
In helm 3 those are namespace scoped but you can also have some charts deployed multiple times under different names so a lock should only apply to one of them.
This is probably the biggest difference between apt/yum because those work at a machine level, but helm can have multiple versions of the same chart installed in a cluster.

Some charts are supposed to be used one per cluster (e.g. nginx-ingress, cluster-autoscaler), but it is up to the cluster operator to know how their cluster wide services are deployed.

### Changing charts
* How does the locking mechanism work? If I lock to kubernetes/nginx-ingress-vX.X.X but I call `helm upgrade my-ingress bitnami/nginx-ingress-vX.X.X`, what happens? What happens if I replace it with a different chart (e.g. apache)?

Chart locking is independant of the chart template.
It would be the responsibility of the chart consumer to make sure chart versions align.

If I deploy an nginx chart and lock it to version 1.18 and then change the chart to apache my deployment should fail if there is no published apache chart at version 1.18.
Users are still free to switch the templates but they should either
* remove the chart version lock before switching
* change the chart version lock to the correct new chart versions
* make sure the new chart has the same version numbers and functionallity

### helm template
* How does this work for users that use `helm template` and then deploy templated charts with `kubectl` or modify templates further with `kustomize`?

Users who use helm as a templating engine and do not deploy charts with helm will not have any releases in their clusters so they will not be able to use this feature.

There is an older PR that looks to stop upgrades from happening for specific components (eg hooks) so parts of charts don't get re-deployed.
This is useful to keep passwords and one time tasks consistent but does not solve the problem addressed in this HIP.
