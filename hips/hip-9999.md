## Abstract

This feature allows installing charts with dependencies other than the ones
specified in Chart.yaml or Chart.lock.

## Motivation

Current design doesn't allow for changes of the dependencies during
installation. A possible workaround in current version would be to fetch the
chart, change the Chart.yaml file, run `helm dependency update` and install
it.

This allows developers to change dependencies of charts without the need to download them and edit them as well as allowing operation where some kind of proxy needsd to be used for repositories.

Some use cases can be found in the [original issue](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/2205).

## Specification

Commands `helm install` and `helm upgrade` would have a new option
`--set-dependency` which would override dependency version and/or repository
for dependencies declared in Chart.yaml. The usage would be for example:  
`helm install chart-name . --set-dependency dep-name.version=1.0.1 --set-dependency
dep-name2.version=2.0.0,dep-name3.repository=helm.sh/repo`  
where dependencies `dep-name`, `dep-name2`, and `dep-name3` were already declared in Chart.yaml. Currently only version and repository can be changed.

This option would also imply the option `--dependency-update` as if it were
called explicitly for the overriden versions to be downloaded.
This specification does not mandate how the `--dependency-update` option
should behave.

The updated charts/ directory must not overwrite dependencies that were
present in the umbrella chart's charts/ folder before the opration as that
would make all subsequent install operations use these changed dependencies.

## Rationale

The decision to not overwrite dependencies prevents users to unwittingly use
wrong versions without changing the declared dependencies and then explicitly
calling `helm dependency update`. This behaviour would be dangerous because
helm does not check versions of present dependencies.

## Backwards compatibility

This HIP would not change any current functionality.

## Security implications

If the malicious user has the ability to add or change CLI arguments of a
legitimate user, they could change the dependencies. Since they can change
the repository, they could install any chart that they prepared beforehand.

## How to teach this

This would be added to the documentation and list of arguments of the
respective commands.

## Reference implementation

Not ready yet.

## Open issues

Should the dependencies be saved or discarded after use?

Should dependencies already present in charts/ directory be used by default or should versions specified in Chart.yaml be located each time?

## Notes

The `--dependency-update` flag currently does not match documentation and
further steps are currently taking place to decide if the feature will
change. If it does not change in v3, this HIP would probably apply only to v4
and later.
