## Abstract

This feature allows installing charts with dependencies other than the ones
specified in Chart.yaml or Chart.lock.

## Motivation

Current design doesn't allow for changes of the dependencies during
installation. A possible workaround in current version would be to fetch the
chart, change the Chart.yaml file, run `helm dependency update` and install
it.

This allows developers to change dependencies of charts without the need to download them and edit them as well as allowing operation where some kind of proxy needs to be used for repositories.

Some use cases can be found in the [original issue](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/2205).

## Specification

Commands `helm install` and `helm upgrade` would have a new option
`--set-dependency` which would override dependency version and/or repository
for dependencies declared in Chart.yaml. The usage would be for example:  
`helm install chart-name . --set-dependency dep-name.version=1.0.1 --set-dependency
dep-name2.version=2.0.0,dep-name3.repository=helm.sh/repo`  
where dependencies `dep-name`, `dep-name2`, and `dep-name3` were already declared in Chart.yaml. Currently only version and repository can be changed.

This option would also imply the option to fetch missing subcharts based on
Chart.yaml as if the option was called explicitly.

The updated charts/ directory must not overwrite dependencies that were
present in the umbrella chart's charts/ folder before the opration as that
would make all subsequent install operations use these changed dependencies.

## Rationale

The decision to not overwrite dependencies prevents users to unwittingly use
wrong versions without changing the declared dependencies and then explicitly
calling `helm dependency update`. This behaviour would be dangerous because
helm does not check versions of present dependencies.

This command would also fetch missing subcharts based on Chart.yaml so that
the implementation can just change the dependencies in memory and resolve
them.  Another option would be to always update based on Chart.yaml, but if
the user already has a version present and does not explicitly call for
updates, using their current versions should be ok.  This can be overriden
with the option to update dependencies (see notes about the new options
planned for v4 concerning this).

## Backwards compatibility

This HIP would not change any current functionality.  The implementation
depends on options planned for v4 and therefore is also planned for v4.

## Security implications

If the malicious user has the ability to add or change CLI arguments of a
legitimate user, they could change the dependencies. Since they can change
the repository, they could install any chart that they prepared beforehand.

## How to teach this

This would be added to the documentation and list of arguments of the
respective commands.

## Reference implementation

Not ready yet.

## Open issues

Should the dependencies be saved or discarded after use?

Should dependencies already present in charts/ directory be used by default
or should versions specified in Chart.yaml be located each time (and
therefore update)?

## Notes

Originally this HIP expected to use `--dependency-update` flag internally,
but there seem to be some bugs with it and it is planned to be changed in v4.
Therefore the newer version will be used pushing this feature to v4 also.
See https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/9545#issuecomment-812045805
Implementation of this HIP would then depend on this feature.
