## Abstract

This feature proposal outlines a concrete plan for finalizing Helm's [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) integration, which has been available as an experimental feature since Helm 3.0.0.

## Motivation

Until now, all OCI integration has been kept separate from the existing Helm user experience, and nested under the `helm chart` and `helm registry` subcommands. These subcommands were designed to mimic the user experience of the Docker CLI. For example, `helm chart list` is the equivalent of `docker images`.

While this experimental feature set has succeeded in providing a "Docker-like" user experience, it is too far removed from existing Helm features and should be partially redesigned.

In addition, there has not yet been a clear response to the following questions concerning Helm's OCI support:

- What is the relationship between a chart version and registry tag?
- Will this work with `helm install` / `helm upgrade` / `helm dependency`?
- How will provenance files (`.prov`) be supported?
- When will the experimental flag be removed?

## Rationale

The true value of leveraging OCI specs has very little to do with the command-line experience (i.e. Docker). OCI registries provide a common API for all types of packages, and address several security and scalability concerns. Additionally, many companies and organizations have invested in the infrastructure surrounding their container registry. Storing Helm charts in a registry reduces the number of moving parts.

By making Helm's OCI support more closely aligned with the way that Helm currently works, users will have a more stable experience and still benefit from the advantages of OCI.

## Specification

The specification for this HIP is broken into six (6) major sections:

1. Implement `Getter` and introduce `Pusher`
2. Support for provenance files
3. Chart versions == OCI reference tags
4. Chart names == OCI reference basenames
5. Cache is removed
6. `helm chart` is removed, integrated into rest of CLI
7. Experimental until clear messaging from OCI

### 1. Implement `Getter` and introduce `Pusher`

As of yet, the code related to registry support has been written standalone (see [internal/experimental/registry](https://github.com/helm/helm/tree/master/internal/experimental/registry)).

The act of downloading a chart from an OCI registry should mimic what is already possible using downloader plugins. Using the protocol prefix `oci://` in any place where chart repos are referenced should work just by implementing a `Getter` for OCI.

Currently there is no Helm-specific way to upload chart packages. Using the same model of `Getter`, a new interface called `Pusher` should be introduced, with a single built-in implementation (OCI). This opens the door for plugins to implement their own upload mechanism, and for Helm to add a new top-level upload command `helm push`.

### 2. Support for provenance files

Helm currently has the ability to verify package signatures, assuming the presence of a file suffixed with `.prov` sitting next to a chart `.tgz` in a repository.

Support for this method of signature validation should be carried over into OCI storage. As the format of the OCI manifest is custom to Helm, Helm can also choose to modify the resulting manifest on upload when a chart is being signed (e.g. `helm push --sign`).

As far as the low-level details, the `.prov` file will simply be stored as a second layer on the manifest. If running `helm pull --verify oci://...`, the second layer (layer at index 1) will be assumed to be the provenance file. The first layer is always the chart `.tgz` itself.

Here is an example of what a manifest will look like with a provenance file attached:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "config": {
    "mediaType": "application/vnd.cncf.helm.config.v1+json",
    "digest": "sha256:8ec7c0f2f6860037c19b54c3cfbab48d9b4b21b485a93d87b64690fdb68c2111",
    "size": 117
  },
  "layers": [
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.cncf.helm.chart.v1",
      "digest": "sha256:1b251d38cfe948dfc0a5745b7af5ca574ecb61e52aed10b19039db39af6e1617",
      "size": 2487
    },
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.cncf.helm.provenance.v1",
      "digest": "sha256:3e207b409db364b595ba862cdc12be96dcdad8e36c59a03b7b3b61c946a5741a",
      "size": 643
    }
  ]
}

```

### 3. Chart versions == OCI reference tags

To keep things simple, the version of a chart will be 1-to-1 with the tag used on registry references. Arbitrary tags will not be supported.

This also means that tags are no longer necessary to be provided on the command-line in the form `<ref>:<tag>`.

The latest sematic version is able to be determined from a registry by listing all tags. To specify a specific tag/version (or if a registry does not support tag listing), users can provide `--version <version>`.

### 4. Chart names == OCI reference basenames

Again, to keep things simple, the basename (the last segment of the URL path) on a registry reference should be equivalent to the chart name. 

For example, given a chart with the name `pepper` and the version `1.2.3`, users may run a command such as the following:

```
$ helm push pepper/ oci://r.myreg.io/mycharts
```

which would result in the following reference:

```
oci://r.myreg.io/mycharts/pepper:1.2.3
```

By placing such restrictions on registry URLs and tags, Helm users are less likely to do "strange things" with charts in registries.

### 5. Cache is removed

Since chart packages are small in size (<1mb), the cache is hard to justify. The cache was introduced only to provide a "Docker-like" experience. While this is neat, it does not provide the user with much value.

By removing the cache, much of the existing OCI features can be cut down dramatically in size. This will make OCI features much more seamless with the existing Helm user experience.

### 6. `helm chart` is removed, integrated into rest of CLI

Wherever possible, the subcommands provided by the new `helm chart` command should be integrated into existing Helm CLI commands.

`helm chart pull` should be baked into `helm pull`, `helm chart push` should be `helm push` (new).

Commands that work with the cache will be removed: `helm chart save`, `helm chart remove` and `helm chart export`.

`helm registry` will be kept as is. This manages auth against OCI registries.


### 7. Experimental until clear messaging from OCI

Considering that the rest of the items above are implemented and resolved, the OCI feature set will not be made generally available until there is clear messaging from the Open Container Initiative (OCI) regarding the way that Helm is using registries.

The technical details of how Helm is using the OCI distribution spec must be validated in writing, in a document approved by OCI, clearly stating that this is the correct way to publish an arbitrary artifact. Only after this will these features be taken out of experimental mode and made generally available.

## Backwards compatibility

Since the existing feature set is currently experimental, there will be no promise of backwards compatibility with prior OCI support (sorry!)

## Security implications

Registry authentication introduces a new attack vector. Upon running `helm registry login`, these credentials are stored in an unencrypted JSON file. With that said, the underlying code is leveraging docker/cli, which has the ability to store these credentials into the system keychain instead.

So, while a new attack vector has been introduced, it should not be considered any less safe than using `docker login`.

Note: this is already implemented in the current OCI feature set.

## How to teach this

Following the implementation of all facets of this HIP, extensive documentation should be added to the Helm website on how to leverage OCI.

Additionally, sites containing community charts, such as [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/), should enable providers to distribute charts over OCI, and display friendly copy-paste instructions for how to download an OCI-based chart.

## Reference implementation

Please see [the Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/) for existing OCI support.

## Rejected ideas

N/A

## Open issues

The issues below are still unresolved.

### What is the correct media type to use for the chart content layer?

The media type for the chart content layer is currently `application/tar+gzip`, however it has been pointed out that [this is not an official type in the IANA database](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).

Either a.) we go through with registering the media type through IANA, or b.) use a unique media type. One alternative could be `application/vnd.cncf.helm.chart.content.layer.v1+tar`.

The only real issue with option b is that the chart package is not technically a unique type. As in, a registry vendor could treat it as a typical gzipped tarball.

### What is the correct media type to use for the provenance file layer?

Again, there doesn't appear to be an IANA media type for this type of file. Additionally, this file format appears unique to Helm.

In this case, it seems the only option is to use a custom media type such as `application/vnd.cncf.helm.chart.provenance.layer.v1`.

### Will I be able to use custom tags such as "latest"?

The implications of this are not yet fully understood. For now, it will be strictly enforced that the tag on the reference will match the version found in `Chart.yaml`. This functionality may be added at a later time.

### Will I be able to pull a chart using the `:<tag>` syntax?

It's unclear if users will be able to pull charts with a specific version using the `:<tag>` syntax (vs. `--version <version>`). This seems relatively harmless to allow both, but this may have implications on dependencies and other areas.
