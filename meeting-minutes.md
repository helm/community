# Meeting Minutes

Every Thursday at 9:30 AM Pacific, the Helm team has a meeting to discuss the
state of the project. This meeting is open to the public.

This document tracks the meeting minutes for those meetings.

Meeting minutes are captured as Google Docs (following SIG methodology) so that
Helm contributors can collaborate.
