# Helm Provisional Governance

As Helm migrates from the Kubernetes org to the CNCF, our governance structure will change.

Under the Kubernetes org, all Helm projects "reported in" via the SIG-Apps special interest group. The core maintainers for each Helm project (Helm, Charts, Chart Museum, Monocular) were responsible for intra-project decisionmaking, and each coordinated with SIG-Apps.

With Helm moving directly under CNCF, we will be setting up the following provisional governance structure:

For a period of 90 days (ending August 30, 2018), the Helm project will be governed by a Governing Board. The Governing Board will consist of all core maintainers on all projects that are currently under the auspices of `kubernetes-helm`. This is limited to the following people:

From Helm Core:

  - adamreese
  - bacongobbler
  - fibonacci1729
  - jascott1
  - mattfarina

(Other Helm projects had 100% overlap with the list above)

Each member must confirm their desire to serve on this board within 3 working days of being notified of this nomination. Any member is entitled to forgo a position on the provisional governance board.

Each person gets only one vote, even if representing multiple projects.

As a founding member of the project, Matt Butcher (technosophos) will serve as chairperson of the board. The board may choose to vote (according to process 2 bellow) to add additional formal roles to the board.

## Role of the Provisional Governing Board

The role of the Provisional Governing Board is twofold:

1. To decide upon a governance structure.
2. To make decisions that cannot be deferred until after the permanent governance structure is put in place.

## Process 1: Process for Deciding Upon Governance Structure

The process for deciding on a permanent governing structure will follow four phases:

- Proposal phase: Any voting members can propose a governance format and guidelines.
- Review phase: Proposals will be reviewed formally
- Refinement phase: Any refinements to the proposals are done. Some proposals may be withdrawn by the submitters or merged with other proposals.
- Decision phase: The governance board will vote to adopt one proposal. A proposal must gain simple majority to be adopted. If this process is deemed overly simplistic or their are too many proposals, the board may vote on changing the rules of the decision phase. A vote of 2/3 will allow for a rule change, which must then in turn be passed by 2/3 majority.

At that point, the provisional governing board will invoke the agreed upon proposal, and disband.

## Process 2: Process for Handling Critical Decisions

In the event that the Provisional Governing Board must decide upon something, decisions will be arrived at through simple majority voting.

- All members must be notified (via the board email list) of the issue to be voted upon
- A special meeting _may_ be called, if warranted
- A written explanation of the decision to be made must be sent to the board email list
- Members will have 2 working days to formally express an objection to voting on the issue
- Voting will be opened for a period of three working days
- Votes will be tallied and the decision made by simple majority

*Special Exception:* In the event that a critical decision about a code of conduct violation by one of the provisional governing board occurs, CNCF will be brought in to assess the situation and make a recommendation.
