# Communication

The Helm community abides by the [CNCF code of conduct].  Here is an excerpt:

> _As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest
> of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect
> all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature
> requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches,
> and other activities._

## Social Media

* [Twitter]
* Pose questions and help answer them on [Slack] or [Stack Overflow].

## Slack

Most real time discussion happens at [#helm-users](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C0NH30761).

There is also a [#helm-dev](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C51E88VDG) channel for discussing development of Helm.
 
Discussions on these channels are archived at [kubernetes.slackarchive.io].

## Issues

Issues are used as the primary method for tracking anything to do with the Helm project.

See the [contributing guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#issues)
for information on how to [file an issue] if you think you have found a bug or have a feature request.

## Mailing lists

Development announcements and discussions appear on the Helm mailing list
[cncf-helm] (send mail to `cncf-helm@lists.cncf.io`).

## Meetings

The Helm community holds regular public meetings, including those supporting Helm
client development and charts. You can [view the calendar of meetings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=s5anaqbm9kda435dnh5r8lj1l8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles)
and [subscribe via an ical](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/s5anaqbm9kda435dnh5r8lj1l8%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) feed.

We have a [weekly development meeting] every Thursday at 9:30am US Pacific Time and all are welcome.

Map that to your local time with this [timezone table].

We keep notes from each meeting on this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d-6xJEx0C78csIYSPKJzRPeWaHG_8W1Hjl72OJggwdc/edit?usp=sharing) for summaries of standups, discussion, and action items.

## Conferences

Helm is one of the projects, represented at CloudNativeCon/KubeCon, held three times per year in Europe, Asia and North America. Information about these and other community events is available on the CNCF [events] pages.

Also, the Helm community organizes the Helm-focused event - [Helm Summit], first
edition of which has happened in Portland, Oregon in February 2018. Our next Europe event will be in Amsterdam on September 11-12, 2019 – details to come.
