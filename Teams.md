# Teams

Helm has various projects being run by different teams with different responsibilities. This document lists out the teams, their responsibilities, and how to contact them directly.

Joining one of these teams is documented in the [governance](governance/governance.md) and with the respective projects within Helm.

## Helm Org Maintainers

The Org Maintainers are a team defined in the [governance](governance/governance.md). This is the high level set of maintainers responsible with the well being of Helm. Consider this a similar team to the Kubernetes Steering Committee.

Repositories under the Helm organization not owned by another team, listed below, are owned by the Org Maintainers.

This team can be directly contacted at the private address of <cncf-helm-maintainers@lists.cncf.io>. The members of this team are documented in the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) file in this repository.

## Security Team

Helm has a security team and process for handling all security issues. This team, the security process, and the method to contact them (including with the use of encryption) is documented in the [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) file in this repository.

## Helm Client and SDK

The [Helm client/CLI and SDK](https://github.com/helm/helm) has a dedicated team maintaining it. The members of that team are documented in the [OWNERS](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/OWNERS) file in the root of the project.

This team can be directly contacted at the private address of <cncf-helm-core-maintainers@lists.cncf.io>.

## Charts Maintainers

The Charts Maintainers handle numerous repositories in the Helm GitHub organization. Specifically, those that deal with Helm charts such as chart [testing](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing), [releasing](https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser), [automation](https://github.com/orgs/helm/repositories?q=action), and [documentation](https://github.com/helm/charts-repo-actions-demo).

The charts maintainers are documented in the [OWNERS](https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/OWNERS) file in the root of the charts repository.

## Website

The [Helm website](https://helm.sh) has its own team and [repository](https://github.com/helm/helm-www). The members of this team are documented in the [OWNERS](https://github.com/helm/helm-www/blob/main/OWNERS) file in that repo.
